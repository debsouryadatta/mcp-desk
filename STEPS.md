### Steps of building the app:

1. `npm create @quick-start/electron@latest` : https://electron-vite.org/guide/
2. Added tailwind v4 with PostCSS: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss
3. Added shadcn ui with vite: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite
4. At the shadcn init step, there was an issue so then switched to manual installation: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/manual
5. For alias configuration, modify the tsconfig.json, tsconfig.web.json, electron.vite.config.ts
